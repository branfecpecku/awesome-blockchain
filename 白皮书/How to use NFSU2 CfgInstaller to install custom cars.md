To use NFSU2 CfgInstaller, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Download the custom car you want to install from a website like [NFSCars](https://www.nfscars.net/). Make sure it has a .u2cfg or .u2car file included.
2. Extract the custom car folder to your NFSU2 "CARS" folder, which is usually located at C:\Program Files\EA Games\Need for Speed Underground 2\CARS. If the folder already exists, overwrite the files.
3. Run NFSU2 CfgInstaller and browse for your NFSU2 folder. Then select the .u2cfg or .u2car file of the custom car you want to install.
4. Click "Install" and wait for the process to finish. You should see a message saying "Installation completed successfully".
5. Launch NFSU2 and enjoy your new car!

Note: Some custom cars may replace existing cars in the game, so make sure you backup your original files before installing them. You can also use NFSU2 CfgInstaller to uninstall custom cars by selecting the original .u2cfg or .u2car file of the replaced car.
  
NFSU2 CfgInstaller is not the only tool you can use to mod NFSU2. There are other tools that can help you enhance the graphics, gameplay, and sound of the game. For example, you can use [NFSU2 Graphics Modpack v1.3](https://www.reddit.com/r/needforspeed/comments/j37vtf/nfs_underground_2_graphics_modpack_v13/) to improve the visual quality of the game with ReShade and Texmod. You can also use [NFSU2 ModTools v1.2](https://nfs-tools.blogspot.com/2017/09/nfs-underground-2-modtools-v12.html) to edit the textures, geometry, and scripts of the game.
 
Modding NFSU2 can be a fun and rewarding experience, but it also comes with some risks. Modding can cause bugs, crashes, or compatibility issues with the game or other mods. It can also violate the terms of service of the game and result in a ban from online play. Therefore, you should always mod at your own risk and responsibility. Make sure you backup your original files before installing any mods, and read the instructions and reviews of the mods carefully before using them.
 
If you want to create your own custom car for NFSU2, you will need some skills and tools to do so. You will need a 3D modeling software like Blender or 3ds Max to create the car model, a texture editing software like Photoshop or GIMP to create the car textures, and a tool like [NFSU2 CfgInstaller](https://nfs-tools.blogspot.com/2016/08/nfs-underground-2-cfginstaller-v15.html) or [NFSU2 ModTools](https://nfs-tools.blogspot.com/2017/09/nfs-underground-2-modtools-v12.html) to convert and install the car files. You will also need to follow the guidelines and specifications of NFSU2 for creating custom cars, such as the number of polygons, materials, parts, and animations. You can find some tutorials and resources on how to create custom cars for NFSU2 on websites like [NFSCars](https://www.nfscars.net/) or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QlOZx0y0qk).
